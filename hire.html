    TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted;
    nor is it ever accidental. Indeed, beauti- fully typeset pages are always
    the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank of
    great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting stands apart from
    ex- pressive artwork, because the appeal is not limited to a small
    circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment, and nowhere does this
    judgment carry more weight. Typography that can- not be read by everybody
    is useless. Even for someone who constantly ponders matters of
    readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether
    something can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at
    once when the type is too small or otherwise irritates the eye; both are
    signs of a certain illegibility already.

    All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a
    smoothly running sentence or as an assembly of lines, which may even have
    contrasting shapes. Good typog- raphy begins, and this is no minor
    matter, with the typeset- ting of a single line of text in a book or a
    newspaper. Using exactly the same typeface, it is possible to create either
    a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is too wide
    or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
